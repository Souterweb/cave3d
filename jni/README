This code is a rewrite of the original code by Nina Amenta.
The code base has been downloaded from 
https://github.com/kubkon/powercrust

and it has been modified to fix memory leaks, so that
it could be made into a library.

It suits my needs which are the surface reconstruction.
The medial axis tranform has not been tested.
